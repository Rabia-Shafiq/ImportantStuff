Hi,

Dear Jean,

Yes, Sure I would do "Advance Analysis" using 'Association rule mining','Cluster Analysis' and 'Decision Tree'.

In order to understand your needs better please confirm me, Do you want me to do 'Simple Analysis' of student data-set as I mentioned in my first message attached doc "DataAnalysisOfStudents" e.g. I have to do analysis using 'frequent item-set mining using FPGrowth algorithm' too?  Or you just need me to do advance analysis as sample analysis I did in last message attached doc 'DM+Algorithms'?
In order to make precise time-cost estimation I believe I should get all the requirements before finalizing anything.

Best Regards,
ElanceCoder

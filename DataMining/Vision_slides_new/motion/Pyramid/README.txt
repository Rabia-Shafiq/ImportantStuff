This contains the code for the 'Expand' and 'Reduce' routines for Gaussian image pyramids, as discussed in the Paper - "
The Laplacian Pyramid as a Compact Image Code" - Burt and Adelson, 1983. 

Important applications of the same include motion estimation etc.


This package contains two files - 

Expand.m  - Function containing the Expand Routine of Gaussian Image Pyramids
Reduce.m  - Function containing the Reduce Routine of Gaussian Image Pyramids
